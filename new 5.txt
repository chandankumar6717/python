Directions
- The data required for this task has been provided in the file 'data.csv'
- Read the questions provided for each cell and assign your answers to respective variables provided in the following cell.
- If answers are floating point numbers round of updo two floating point after the decimal
  - for example 10.546 should be read as 10.55, 10.544 as 10.54 and 10.1 as 10.10
- pandas and numpy packages are preinstalled for this task which should be sufficient to complete this task.
- If you need any other additional package run !pip3 install <package_name> --user in a new cell.
- You can either try out the solution in the same notebook or free to create additional notebook, but make sure you come back to this notebook to answer the questions.
- Please dont change variable name meant to assign your answers.
- Dont leave any of the answers blank for you test cases run smoothly

Out of all the available records which month has the lowest average humidity.
- Assign your answer as month index, for example if its July index is 7
dew_month = 
dew_month = 
Which month has the highest median for maximum_gust_speed out of all the available records. Also find the repective value
- hint: group by month
max_gust_value = 
max_gust_month = 
Determine the average temperature between the months of March 2010 to May 2012 (including both the months)
avg_temp = 
Find the range of averange temperature on Dec 2010
temp_range = 
Out of all available records which day has the highest difference between maximum_pressure and minimum_pressure
- assign the date in string format as 'yyyy-mm-dd'. Make sure you enclose it with single quote
max_p_range_day = 
How many days falls under median of barrometer reading.
